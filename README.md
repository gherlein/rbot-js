# rbot-js.js
 
Reads from an XBox360(tm) via an MQTT queue provided by 
[goxb_mqtt](https://github.com/gherlein/goxb_mqtt) and sends MQTT messages to a queue on
a Raspberry Pi that feeds [pi-blaster-mqtt](see https://github.com/gherlein/pi-blaster-mqtt) 
running on the Pi.

## Early Days

Eventually will be a library and then exaples and will use a config file to map XBox controller
events to motors/action
